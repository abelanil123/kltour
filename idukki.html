                Hill View Park is located close to Idukki Dam and Cheruthoni Dam. The park is 350 feet above the water level of the dam. Hill View Park is located at a distance of 1.5 km from Idukki. The beautifully landscaped garden is spread over 8 acres. It also has a natural lake to add to its charm. As the name suggests, visitors can get a beautiful view of the environment from here. Deer, wild buffalo and elephants roam freely in their natural habitat. A boat ride through the lake will make the views of the forest a little closer and more vibrant. There is a garden of herbs and playgrounds where children can have fun. A visit to Idukki would not be complete without visiting Hill View Park.</p>
